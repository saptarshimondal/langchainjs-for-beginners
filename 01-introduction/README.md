## 📖 Introduction: The Hardware Store Analogy

**Imagine you're building a house.** You could certainly manufacture your own bricks, create cement from scratch, and forge your own tools. Or, you could use a hardware store that provides quality materials and proven tools.

**LangChain.js is the hardware store for AI development.**

Just like a hardware store provides:
- 🔨 **Pre-made tools** (hammers, saws, drills)
- 🧱 **Quality materials** (lumber, nails, paint)
- 📋 **Blueprints** (how-to guides)
- 🔄 **Interchangeable parts** (standard sizes that work together)

LangChain.js provides:
- 🔨 **Pre-built components** (chat models, prompts, tools)
- 🧱 **Quality abstractions** (works with any LLM provider)
- 📋 **Patterns** (common AI application designs)
- 🔄 **Composability** (components that work together seamlessly)

**The result?** You can focus on building your application, not reinventing the wheel.

## 🧠 What is LangChain.js?

LangChain.js is a **framework for building AI-powered applications** using Large Language Models ([LLMs](../GLOSSARY.md#llm-large-language-model)).

### The Problem It Solves

Without LangChain.js, you'd need to:
- Write different code for each LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.)
- Build your own prompt management system
- Create custom tools and function calling logic
- Implement memory and conversation handling from scratch
- Build agent systems without any structure

### The LangChain.js Solution

With LangChain.js, you get:

- **[Provider](../GLOSSARY.md#provider) abstraction** - Switch between OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic with minimal code changes
- **Prompt templates** - Reusable, testable prompts
- **Tools** - Extend AI with custom functions and APIs
- **Memory** - Built-in conversation history
- **Agents** - Decision-making AI that can use tools

---

## 🏗️ Core Concepts Overview

LangChain.js is built around 5 core concepts you'll learn throughout this course:

- **[Models](../GLOSSARY.md#model)**: AI "brains" that process inputs and generate outputs. Learn in this chapter.
- **[Prompts](../GLOSSARY.md#prompt)**: How you communicate with AI models using reusable templates. See [Prompts, Messages, and Structured Outputs](../03-prompts-messages-outputs/README.md).
- **[Tools](../GLOSSARY.md#tool)**: Extend AI capabilities with external functions and APIs. Build in [Function Calling & Tools](../04-function-calling-tools/README.md).
- **[Agents](../GLOSSARY.md#agent)**: AI systems that reason and decide which tools to use autonomously. Create in [Getting Started with Agents](../05-agents/README.md).
- **[Memory](../GLOSSARY.md#memory)**: Remember context across interactions. Implement in [Chat Models & Basic Interactions](../02-chat-models/README.md).

---

### How These Concepts Work Together

As you progress through the course, you'll see how these concepts combine:

```mermaid

    A[User Input] --> B[Memory]
    B --> C[Prompts]
    C --> D[Tools/Agents]
    D --> E[Models]
    E --> F[Response]
```

**Don't worry about understanding everything now!** You'll learn each concept hands-on, building progressively more sophisticated applications. Let's start with your first AI call.

## 💻 Hands-On: Your First LLM Call

Let's make your first AI call using LangChain.js and Microsoft Foundry!

### Example 1: Hello World

In this example, you'll create your first LangChain.js program that sends a simple message to an AI model and displays the response.

Let's build this step by step:

**Step 1: Import what we need**

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import "dotenv/config";
```

**Step 2: Create the AI model**

```typescript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: process.env.AI_MODEL,
  configuration: { baseURL: process.env.AI_ENDPOINT },
  apiKey: process.env.AI_API_KEY
});
```

**Step 3: Ask the AI a question**

```typescript
const response = await model.invoke("What is LangChain in one sentence?");
console.log("🤖 AI Response:", response.content);
```

**Code**: [`code/01-hello-world.ts`](./code/01-hello-world.ts)  
**Run**: `tsx 01-introduction/code/01-hello-world.ts`

**Example code**:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import "dotenv/config";

async function main() {
  console.log("🚀 Hello LangChain.js!\n");

  // Create a chat model instance
  const model = new ChatOpenAI({
    model: process.env.AI_MODEL,
    configuration: { baseURL: process.env.AI_ENDPOINT },
    apiKey: process.env.AI_API_KEY
  });

  // Make your first AI call!
  const response = await model.invoke("What is LangChain in one sentence?");

  console.log("🤖 AI Response:", response.content);
  console.log("\n✅ Success! You just made your first LangChain.js call!");
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

> **🤖 Try with [GitHub Copilot](../docs/copilot.md) Chat:** Want to explore this code further? Open this file in your editor and ask Copilot:
> - "What does the invoke() method return and how do I access different properties?"
> - "How does the configuration baseURL work with different AI providers?"

### Expected Output

When you run this example with `tsx 01-introduction/code/01-hello-world.ts`, you'll see:

```
🚀 Hello LangChain.js!

🤖 AI Response: LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

✅ Success! You just made your first LangChain.js call!
```

### How It Works

**What's happening here?**
1. We import `ChatOpenAI` from the `@langchain/openai` package
2. We create a model instance by instantiating `ChatOpenAI` with configuration
3. We call `invoke()` with a simple string prompt
4. We get back a response with the AI's answer

<img src="images/first-llm-call-flow.png" alt="First LLM Call Flow" width="800"/>

*The flow of your first LLM call - from creating a model instance to receiving a response*

**Understanding ChatOpenAI Configuration**:

The `ChatOpenAI` constructor takes three key properties: `model` (which AI model), `configuration.baseURL` (API endpoint), and `apiKey` (authentication).

We read these from environment variables (`AI_MODEL`, `AI_ENDPOINT`, `AI_API_KEY`) defined in your `.env` file. This keeps credentials out of code and lets you switch providers by updating `.env`.

**Why use environment variables?**
- `AI_MODEL` specifies which AI model to use (like `gpt-5-mini` or `gpt-5`)
- `AI_ENDPOINT` tells the application where to find the AI service
- `AI_API_KEY` provides authentication credentials

Storing these in `.env` means you can change Microsoft Foundry endpoints, keys, and models by updating the configuration file, not your code. It's like changing a phone number in your contacts. Same calling process, different destination.

## 💬 Understanding Messages

LLMs work best with structured conversations. LangChain.js provides message types that separate system instructions (`SystemMessage`) from user input (`HumanMessage`), giving you precise control over the AI's personality and behavior.

### Example 2: Message Types

Let's see how to use SystemMessage and HumanMessage to control AI behavior and set the tone of responses.

**Code**: [`code/02-message-types.ts`](./code/02-message-types.ts)  
**Run**: `tsx 01-introduction/code/02-message-types.ts`

**Example code:**

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { HumanMessage, SystemMessage } from "langchain";
import "dotenv/config";

async function main() {
  console.log("🎭 Understanding Message Types\n");

  const model = new ChatOpenAI({
    model: process.env.AI_MODEL,
    configuration: { baseURL: process.env.AI_ENDPOINT },
    apiKey: process.env.AI_API_KEY
  });

  // Using structured messages for better control
  const messages = [
    new SystemMessage("You are a helpful AI assistant who explains things simply."),
    new HumanMessage("Explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old."),
  ];

  const response = await model.invoke(messages);

  console.log("🤖 AI Response:\n");
  console.log(response.content);
  console.log("\n✅ Notice how the SystemMessage influenced the response style!");
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

> **🤖 Try with [GitHub Copilot](../docs/copilot.md) Chat:** Want to explore this code further? Open this file in your editor and ask Copilot:
> - "What's the difference between SystemMessage and HumanMessage?"
> - "How would I add an AIMessage to continue this conversation?"

### Expected Output

When you run this example with `tsx 01-introduction/code/02-message-types.ts`, you'll see:

```
🎭 Understanding Message Types

🤖 AI Response: Quantum computing is like having a super-fast magic box that can try many different solutions to a puzzle at the same time! While regular computers look at one answer at a time, quantum computers can explore lots of possibilities all at once, which helps them solve really hard problems much faster.
```

### How It Works

**Message Types**:
- **SystemMessage**: Sets the AI's behavior and personality
- **HumanMessage**: User input
- **AIMessage**: The AI's responses (usually added automatically)

**What's happening**:
1. The SystemMessage tells the AI to explain things simply (like to a beginner)
2. The HumanMessage contains the user's question about quantum computing
3. The AI crafts a response that matches the system instruction (simple explanation)
4. Because we set the personality in the SystemMessage, the response is age-appropriate and clear

<img src="images/message-types-flow.png" alt="Message Types Flow" width="800"/>

*How SystemMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage work together in a conversation*

**Why use messages instead of strings?**
- Better control over AI behavior
- Maintains conversation context
- More powerful and flexible

## 🔄 Comparing Models

Google Gemini gives you access to multiple AI models via the OpenAI Compatibility API. Let's compare them!

**You're building an app and need to choose which model to use.** Should you use `gemini-3.8-flash` (more capable but costlier) or `gemini-3.8-flash-lite` (faster and cheaper)?

Think of it like choosing between calculators: a scientific calculator handles complex equations but takes more time and resources, while a basic calculator is fast and efficient for simple math. The best way to decide is to test both with your actual prompts and compare their responses.

### Example 3: Model Comparison

Let's see how to programmatically compare different models side-by-side. 

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you have an active Gemini API key configured in your `.env` file as described in [Course Setup](../00-course-setup/README.md#set-up-gemini-api).

**Code**: [`code/03-model-comparison.ts`](./code/03-model-comparison.ts)  
**Run**: `tsx 01-introduction/code/03-model-comparison.ts`

**Example code:**

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import "dotenv/config";

async function compareModels() {
  console.log("🔬 Comparing AI Models\n");

  const prompt = "Explain recursion in programming in one sentence.";
  const models = ["gemini-3.8-flash", "gemini-3.8-flash-lite"];

  for (const modelName of models) {
    console.log(`\n📊 Testing: ${modelName}`);
    console.log("─".repeat(50));

    // Override the model for this test
    const model = new ChatOpenAI({
      model: modelName,
      configuration: { baseURL: process.env.AI_ENDPOINT },
      apiKey: process.env.AI_API_KEY,
    });

    const startTime = Date.now();
    const response = await model.invoke(prompt);
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime;

    console.log(`Response: ${response.content}`);
    console.log(`⏱️  Time: ${duration}ms`);
  }

  console.log("\n✅ Comparison complete!");
  console.log("\n💡 Key Observations:");
  console.log("   - gemini-3.8-flash is more capable and detailed for complex reasoning");
  console.log("   - gemini-3.8-flash-lite is faster and well-suited for high-volume tasks");
  console.log("   - Choose based on your needs: speed vs. capability");
}

compareModels().catch(console.error);
```

> **🤖 Try with [GitHub Copilot](../docs/copilot.md) Chat:** Want to explore this code further? Open this file in your editor and ask Copilot:
> - "Why do we create a new ChatOpenAI instance inside the loop?"
> - "How can I add another model to this comparison?"

### Expected Output

When you run this example with `tsx 01-introduction/code/03-model-comparison.ts`, you'll see:

```
🔬 Comparing AI Models


📊 Testing: gpt-5
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Response: Recursion in programming is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem until it reaches a base case.
⏱️  Time: 2134ms

📊 Testing: gpt-5-mini
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Response: Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar sub-problems.
⏱️  Time: 1845ms

✅ Comparison complete!

💡 Key Observations:
   - gpt-5 is more capable and detailed
   - gpt-5-mini is faster and uses fewer resources
   - Choose based on your needs: speed vs. capability
```

> **Note**: Your AI's response may vary slightly from this example, and timing will depend on your network connection and API load. This is normal - LLMs generate different responses each time.

### How It Works

**What's happening**:
1. We define a single prompt asking about recursion
2. We loop through two different models: `gpt-5` and `gpt-5-mini`
3. For each model, we create a new `ChatOpenAI` instance with that model name
4. We invoke the same prompt on each model
5. We display the response from each model for comparison

**What you'll notice**:
- Different models have different response styles
- `gpt-5` tends to be more detailed and sophisticated
- `gpt-5-mini` is more concise but still accurate
- Both answers are correct, just expressed differently
- `gpt-5` is more capable for complex tasks, `gpt-5-mini` is faster and cheaper for simple tasks
